Description: # Have I Been Pwned?
        
        Python interface to Have I Been Pwned API
        
        
        ## What is Have I Been Pwned?
        
        [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a free resource to quickly assess if an account or domain has been compromised or "pwned" in a data breach. By aggregating the data here the project helps victims be aware of account compromises, and highlights the severity of the risks of Internet-wide attacks.

        ## Dependencies
        
        ```
        requests
        gevent
        ```
        
        ## Setup
        
        This library runs on **Python3.x+**
        
        To install, run:
        
        ```
        $ pip install hibp
        ```
        
        ## To run
        
        You can query breach data on individual accounts/domains as well as data on full breaches. Each service request object contains a response attribute that holds the raw data output in JSON format. To perform a query, just setup a service request object, and then execute:
        
        ```python
        >> req = HIBP.get_account_breaches("pegasos1")
        >> req.execute()
        >> req.response
        ```
        
        
        If you want to query on multiple accounts or domains at once, you can use the `AsyncHIBP` object, which performs queries concurrently via gevent.
        
        ```python
        >> names = ['adobe','ashleymadison', 'myspace']
        >> breaches = [HIBP.get_breach(x) for x in names]
        >> async_reqs = AsyncHIBP().map(breaches)
        >> [async_req.response for async_req in async_reqs]
        ```
        
        In addition to a canonical `map` method, `AsyncHIBP` also supports the `imap` method, which returns a generator object for lazy queries.
        
        
        ```python
        >> domains = ['twitter.com','facebook.com', 'adobe.com']
        >> breaches = [HIBP.get_domain_breaches(x) for x in domains]
        >> async_reqs = AsyncHIBP().imap(breaches)
        >> next(async_reqs)
        ```
